# Introduction: What is Prometheus Swarm?

Prometheus Swarm is an open-source AI platform that uses a "swarm" of intelligent agents running on a decentralized network (Koii) to build software from natural language descriptions. This technology aims to **change the world** by democratizing software development, enabling anyone to turn ideas into reliable applications.

Imagine thousands of AI agents working in parallel across Koii's global network of over 100,000 community-run computers. They produce code in real time, making Prometheus potentially "the first AI capable of anything" in software creation.

*   **What Prometheus Is:** Prometheus Swarm is an AI framework powered by decentralized compute. It orchestrates autonomous AI coding agents that collaboratively build, test, and deploy applications.
*   **How It Works at High Level:** Thousands of distributed agents collaborate to write and improve code, continuously updating a Git repository in real time. The system supports multiple AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and employs modular tool-chaining.
*   **Why It Matters:** This is a breakthrough â€“ anyone can build software by describing their idea, overcoming traditional skill barriers. Prometheus Swarm promises to **empower creators and teams** to build solutions faster and more cost-efficiently than ever, heralding a new era of AI-driven development.
*   **Open-Source and Community:** The project is completely open source with an active community. You can find all code and ongoing development at the GitHub organization: [Prometheus-Swarm](https://github.com/Prometheus-Swarm). This transparency invites developers to inspect code or contribute, reinforcing trust.
*   **Call to Action:** Explore further or **Try Prometheus Swarm** (link to official site/quick start needed) now that you grasp its significance.
