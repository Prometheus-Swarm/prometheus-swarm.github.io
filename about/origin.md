# Our Origin Story: From Myth to Innovation

Prometheus Swarm draws its name and inspiration from the Greek myth of Prometheus, the titan who gifted fire – a powerful, transformative technology – to humanity. Similarly, Prometheus Swarm aims to give the "fire" of AI-driven software development capabilities to everyone, democratizing creation.

*   **Mythical Inspiration:** Just as Prometheus brought fire to empower humans, Prometheus Swarm brings powerful AI-driven development tools to all creators. The platform's mission is to empower and transform the world of software creation by democratizing access to this "creative fire."

*   **Koii Team & Background:** The project was conceived and built by Al Morris and the Koii Network team. Koii Network is a decentralized compute network with approximately 100,000+ community-run nodes, built on a philosophy of open development and incentive design. This robust, distributed infrastructure and expertise in decentralized systems form the foundation upon which Prometheus Swarm is built.

*   **Genesis of the Idea:** The idea for Prometheus Swarm emerged from tackling real-world challenges in early AI-assisted coding. The team's initial experiments with "vibe coding" (using AI to generate code from natural language) were promising but often resulted in error-prone and unreliable applications. This spurred the determination to invent a more rigorous, industrialized, and modular workflow that could reliably turn ideas into working software, addressing common AI pitfalls like "hallucinations." Prometheus Swarm officially launched in early 2025, with support from the Koii Foundation, as a solution to these problems.

*   **Milestones & Alliances:** Key milestones include the mainnet launch on March 10, 2025. Within weeks, Prometheus Swarm had already partnered with over [50 projects](https://x.com/PrometheusSwarm), demonstrating strong early adoption and validating the demand for AI-generated software at scale. The project continues to foster community engagement through meetups and collaborations, such as with Swarms.ai.

*   **Vision Statement:** The long-term vision is a future where building software is as accessible as telling a story. Prometheus Swarm, through its union of mythic ambition and practical innovation, strives to make this a reality. The ethos from day one has been open-source and community-first: "everything we do is open source…you're welcome to pivot on it, take it your own direction."
