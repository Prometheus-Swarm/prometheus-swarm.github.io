I’ll now create a specific, grouped GitBook update plan for [https://prometheus-swarm.github.io](https://prometheus-swarm.github.io) that introduces and clearly presents Prometheus Swarm’s story, offering, technical architecture, payment model, and onboarding journey. All major user types—non-devs, developers, and enterprise clients—will be guided to relevant sections.

I'll let you know when the full scope of changes is ready for review and implementation.


# Prometheus Swarm GitBook Update Outline

## Introduction: What is Prometheus Swarm?

**Suggested GitBook Path:** `README.md` (or `introduction.md` at root)

**Summary:**
Introduce Prometheus Swarm as an open-source AI platform that uses a “swarm” of intelligent agents running on a decentralized network to build software from natural language descriptions. Emphasize how this technology can **change the world** by democratizing software development – enabling anyone to turn ideas into reliable applications. Highlight the unique value: thousands of AI agents working in parallel across Koii’s global node network to produce code in real time, making Prometheus “the first AI capable of anything” in software creation.

* **What Prometheus Is:** A brief definition of Prometheus Swarm as an AI framework powered by decentralized compute (Koii network). Explain that it orchestrates autonomous AI coding agents to collaboratively build, test, and deploy applications.
* **How It Works at High Level:** Thousands of distributed agents (running on hundreds of thousands of nodes worldwide) collaborate to write and improve code, continuously updating a Git repository in real time. Mention multi-model support (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, etc.) and modular tool-chaining as part of the system.
* **Why It Matters:** Emphasize the breakthrough – anyone can build software by describing their idea, overcoming traditional skill barriers. Prometheus Swarm promises to **empower creators and teams** to build solutions faster and more cost-efficiently than ever, heralding a new era of AI-driven development.
* **Open-Source and Community:** Note that the project is completely open source with an active community (link to GitHub org **Prometheus-Swarm**). This invites developers to inspect code or contribute, reinforcing transparency and trust.
* **Call to Action:** Encourage readers to explore further or **“Try Prometheus Swarm”** (with a link to the official site or quick start) now that they grasp its significance.

## Our Origin Story: From Myth to Innovation

**Suggested GitBook Path:** `about/origin.md`

**Summary:**
Tell the **origin story** of Prometheus Swarm to give context and inspire trust. Reference the Greek myth of Prometheus – the titan who gave fire (knowledge) to humanity – as the inspiration for the name, symbolizing how this platform “gives the fire” of AI development capabilities to everyone. Introduce the Koii team behind Prometheus, noting their background in decentralized computing and the journey that led to this innovation. This section establishes the project’s vision and credibility by connecting past efforts to the current mission.

* **Mythical Inspiration:** Explain why the project is named “Prometheus.” Prometheus in mythology brought fire (a powerful technology) to humans; likewise, Prometheus Swarm brings powerful AI-driven development to human creators. This frames the platform’s mission to empower and transform the world of software creation (democratizing access to “creative fire”).
* **Koii Team & Background:** Introduce the creators (e.g. Al Morris and the Koii Network team) and their expertise. Mention Koii Network’s achievements – a decentralized compute network of \~100k+ community-run nodes and a philosophy of open development. This shows the foundation Prometheus is built on.
* **Genesis of the Idea:** Describe how the idea for Prometheus arose from real challenges. For example, the team’s experience with *“vibe coding”* (natural language coding with AI) revealed pitfalls like hallucinations and buggy code. Determined to fix this, they applied rigorous process design to AI coding. Tie this into the project’s founding moment – the recognition that industrial-grade processes could make AI coding reliable.
* **Milestones & Alliances:** Note any key milestones (e.g. mainnet launch on Jan 3, 2025, partnerships like with Swarms.ai, or community meetups). This demonstrates momentum. For instance, mention that Prometheus Swarm quickly gained dozens of partners within weeks of launch.
* **Vision Statement:** Close with the long-term vision: a future where building software is as accessible as telling a story, enabled by Prometheus Swarm’s union of mythic ambition and practical innovation. (Optionally include a quote from the founder or a manifesto line.)

## For Creators & Innovators (Non‑Developers)

**Suggested GitBook Path:** `guides/for-creators.md`

**Summary:**
Address **non-technical users** – creators, entrepreneurs, educators, idea people – explaining what Prometheus offers **beyond basic ChatGPT or no-code tools**. Emphasize that with Prometheus Swarm, they can go from concept to working product **without writing code**, leveraging AI agents that handle the heavy lifting. Highlight how the platform’s structured swarm approach overcomes the typical shortcomings of simple AI coding (like hallucinations or half-working apps) and produces real, deployable results. This section should excite and assure non-developers that they can achieve software projects previously out of reach.

* **Empowerment Through AI:** Explain in simple terms that creators can build software by describing what they need – Prometheus turns ideas into code. Unlike one-off AI scripts or “vibe coding” hacks, Prometheus provides *industrial-grade* reliability and repeatability. Non-developers get access to a personal “software development team” of AI agents.
* **Beyond ChatGPT or DIY Coding:** Acknowledge that tools like ChatGPT can generate code snippets, but contrast that with Prometheus Swarm’s full project capabilities. For example, instead of a fragment that might not integrate, Prometheus delivers an end-to-end solution (from code to tests and docs) thanks to specialized agents and rigorous process. Emphasize no more copy-paste uncertainty – the swarm ensures the pieces actually work together.
* **Real-World Use Cases:** Provide concrete scenarios that resonate with non-tech users. E.g. *“Have an idea for a web app or a game? Describe it, and the swarm can build it.”* Mention the LinkedIn examples: a student built their first interactive tool, a solo founder launched a product in a weekend, a designer automated a workflow – all **without writing code**. These stories show that *anyone* can create with Prometheus.
* **Trust and Quality for Non-Devs:** Reassure readers that they won’t be left with a buggy prototype. Prometheus Swarm agents produce clean, human-readable code and even documentation, so users (or any hired developers) can understand and maintain it. The swarm’s testing phase catches issues that non-experts wouldn’t know to check, delivering a working product – not a “vibe coding” nightmare.
* **Getting Started CTA:** Instruct how a non-developer can begin. E.g. *“Start by writing a short description of what you want to build and feed it into Prometheus Swarm’s interface.”* Highlight an easy onboarding or a template for idea submission. Encourage them to **try the platform** on a small idea and include a link to the “Try Prometheus” or a tutorial.

## For Developers: Leverage the Swarm for Speed and Scale

**Suggested GitBook Path:** `guides/for-developers.md`

**Summary:**
Speak to **software developers** and technical users about Prometheus Swarm’s offering. Emphasize why this platform is the **best ally for developers**: it can dramatically accelerate development, handle boilerplate or repetitive tasks, and improve code quality through its multi-agent design. Highlight unique advantages like modular code generation, built-in testing, multi-model AI integration, and the ability to tackle large projects in parallel. The goal is to show developers that Prometheus isn’t here to replace them, but to 10x their productivity and eliminate drudgery, all while remaining open and extensible.

* **Why Use Prometheus as a Dev:** Explain that Prometheus Swarm can save time and augment skills. It can generate entire features or components on demand, allowing developers to focus on high-level design. The swarm approach means critical components (tests, docs, bug fixes) are generated alongside features. This results in more complete and stable codebases with less manual effort.
* **Best-in-Class Code Generation:** Contrast Prometheus with other AI coding tools. Note that typical AI code assistants may produce code that’s hard to debug or incomplete. Prometheus was built by developers who encountered those pain points and solved them with process: e.g., breaking tasks into clear scopes, enforcing test-driven development, and having agents review each other’s work. The outcome is production-grade code that developers can trust and easily read (type-safe, well-documented code, not spaghetti).
* **Integration & Control:** Describe how developers remain in control. Prometheus works with GitHub – the swarm commits code as pull requests that developers can review and merge. It’s not a black-box: you can watch agents collaborating in the open source repo in real time. Developers can run Prometheus locally or on their infrastructure, integrate it with CI/CD, and even tweak agent behaviors (since the framework is open-source). This flexibility and transparency are huge advantages for professional use.
* **Core Developer Features:** List features that matter to devs, citing existing docs where appropriate:

  * *Multi-Model AI:* Use the best of GPT-4, Claude, etc., via a unified workflow.
  * *Modular Architecture:* Each feature is built as an independent module (with its own tests), making code easy to maintain or replace.
  * *Automated Testing & Debugging:* The Prometheus Test framework (part of the platform) automatically generates and runs tests for each module. Specialized “Bug Finder” agents scan for issues and security holes.
  * *Documentation Generation:* A “Documentation Agent” produces inline code docs and user guides as the code is written, saving you the effort.
  * *Scalability:* The swarm can work on multiple parts of a project in parallel (horizontal scalability), speeding up large development tasks that would bottleneck a single developer or small team.
* **Call to Action:** Encourage developers to explore the Quick Start or API reference to integrate Prometheus into their workflow. Provide links to the GitHub repo (for code) and documentation for installation (e.g., `pip install prometheus-swarm`) so they can **try it out in their own project**.

## For Enterprise & Partners: Custom Solutions and Token Integration

**Suggested GitBook Path:** `guides/for-enterprise.md`

**Summary:**
Address **enterprise users and business partners**, highlighting how Prometheus Swarm can be tailored to their needs. Emphasize scalability, security, and the unique **“pay in any token” support** that lets companies use their own native tokens or preferred payment methods to access the decentralized compute power. Discuss how Prometheus can integrate into existing workflows or platforms, enabling enterprises to rapidly develop new products or automate processes with AI while leveraging their own ecosystems. This section should convey that Prometheus is **enterprise-ready** – flexible, cost-effective, and able to unlock value (even creating token-driven business models).

* **Scalable & Secure for Enterprise:** Explain that because Prometheus runs on a decentralized network of nodes, it can scale to handle large workloads without centralized bottlenecks. The Koii network’s thousands of nodes provide reliable, distributed compute power. Mention security considerations: code and data can be processed in a distributed way, and the process can include security scanning (the Bug Finder agent) to ensure robust outputs – important for enterprise-grade software.
* **Custom Integration:** Describe how enterprises can integrate Prometheus into their stack. For instance, an organization could link Prometheus to their proprietary GitHub repositories or internal project management tools. The AI agents can be instructed with company-specific guidelines or use custom knowledge bases (via the KNO SDK for documentation embeddings, if relevant). This means Prometheus can adapt to domain-specific tasks (e.g., generating code that interfaces with the enterprise’s own APIs or databases).
* **Pay in Any Token:** Highlight the innovative payment flexibility: enterprises with their own blockchain or token can use that to compensate the node operators who power Prometheus tasks. The Koii network allows any existing token to be used for payments, unlike typical platforms that require fiat or a specific coin. This is ideal for Web3 projects or partners who want to utilize their native token for AI compute. (For example, if a gaming company has a token, they could pay the Prometheus network with it to build their app, creating utility for their token.)
* **Enterprise Use Cases:** Give examples of how an enterprise might use Prometheus Swarm. E.g. *“A fintech company can rapidly prototype a new analytics tool by describing requirements to Prometheus – saving months of developer time.”* Or *“A blockchain project can auto-generate a suite of smart contracts and dApps, with Prometheus agents ensuring security and correctness, all while the project pays node operators in their own token.”* These scenarios illustrate real value: faster time-to-market and leveraging AI while keeping control.
* **Partnership and Support:** Reassure that the Prometheus team offers support for enterprise integration. Mention if there’s an enterprise API or service tier. Encourage interested partners to **get in touch or join the Prometheus enterprise program** (include a contact link or call-to-action to discuss custom needs).

## Platform Architecture & Core Components

**Suggested GitBook Path:** `how-it-works/architecture.md`

**Summary:**
Provide a **technical overview** of Prometheus Swarm’s architecture and core components. This section is aimed at readers who want to understand how the system is built (developers, technical decision-makers). Describe the major pieces of the Prometheus platform – both software components (like the Prometheus Swarm framework, Test framework, and various agent roles) and infrastructure (the Koii decentralized hosting). The content should clarify how all the parts work together to deliver the end-to-end functionality. Include references to the open-source repositories for those who want to dive deeper or contribute.

* **Overall Architecture:** Start with a high-level diagram or description of how Prometheus works internally. For example: *“Prometheus Swarm operates on a multi-layer architecture: at the top, a **Planner agent** interprets the user’s idea into a detailed plan; in the middle, multiple **Builder agents** generate code for different features in parallel; then **Tester/Red-Team agents** verify and attack the code; finally an **Optimizer/Architect agent** refines and integrates the codebase.”* Illustrate how these agents coordinate via a shared queue or workflow engine (the **Workflow management** mentioned in docs). Note how everything is version-controlled in Git throughout the process.
* **Core Software Components:** List and describe the key software modules of Prometheus:

  * *Prometheus Swarm (Core Framework):* Orchestrates agents and workflows. Handles multi-model AI integration (e.g., calling GPT-4, Claude), and manages state, context, and type-safe interfaces for code generation. (Link to `prometheus-swarm` repo or docs for more details.)
  * *Prometheus Test Framework:* Ensures every task has corresponding tests. Provides structured testing, worker management, and reporting. This is how the swarm systematically validates outputs. (Link to `prometheus-test` repo or docs.)
  * *Knowledge Integration (KNO SDK):* (If applicable) A component that indexes documentation or existing code into embeddings for agents to use as context. This allows agents to understand the codebase progressively and reuse knowledge. Reference the `kno-sdk` repository as the implementation of this feature.
  * *Agent Libraries:* Explain that specialized agent types correspond to separate modules (and repos). For example, **Feature Builder Agent** (in `feature-builder` repo) focuses on writing new features and docs, **Bug Finder Agent** (`bug-finder` repo) hunts for bugs and vulnerabilities, **Documentation Agent** handles docs generation, etc. Mention that these agents use different AI models and strategies suited to their task.
* **Decentralized Hosting (Koii Network):** Describe how the Koii blockchain network provides the computing substrate. Prometheus tasks are distributed to Koii “hacker nodes” (compute nodes) which run the AI models and code generation jobs in parallel. Emphasize the benefits: decentralization means no single point of failure, and a large pool of nodes means tasks can execute concurrently at scale. Koii’s network incentives (node operators earning tokens) ensure reliability and growth. Optionally, mention that Koii’s **Cloud2** approach turned even small devices into part of this supercomputer.
* **Diagram/Visualization:** (If possible, include or suggest an architecture diagram showing the user input -> planner -> multiple agents -> testing -> output flow, and how it sits on the Koii decentralized cloud. The diagram can also label core components like “Prometheus Swarm core” and agent names.)
* **References:** Provide links or citations to further technical reading – e.g., link to the GitHub **PrometheusMonorepo** or core docs for those who want to see the code, and perhaps to a technical whitepaper if available. Indicate that all components are open source in the Prometheus-Swarm GitHub org.

## From Idea to Code: Prometheus Usage Process

**Suggested GitBook Path:** `how-it-works/usage-process.md`

**Summary:**
Walk readers through the **end-to-end process of using Prometheus Swarm**, from the moment they have an idea to the moment they receive working code. This section should serve as a **guided tour** of what happens and what the user needs to do at each stage. It will bridge the gap between concept and execution, making it clear how to interact with Prometheus (e.g. via a web app or CLI), what inputs to provide, and what outputs/feedback to expect. By the end of this walkthrough, readers should know how to go from *“I have an idea”* to *“I have the code/product”* using the platform.

* **1. Ideation & Scoping:** Explain that the user begins by describing their idea or project goals in natural language. Prometheus assists in refining this into a clear **Scope of Work**. (For example, mention that the system may ask follow-up questions to clarify requirements.) The result is a well-defined project specification with tasks broken down – a crucial step to avoid misinterpretation.
* **2. Planning (Planner Agent):** Once the scope is set, the Planner agent (with an LLM like GPT-4) turns the specification into a development plan. Describe this plan as including a list of components or features to build, each with acceptance criteria. The user at this stage may review or adjust the plan before proceeding (ensuring it matches their vision).
* **3. Code Generation (Swarm of Builder Agents):** Next, Prometheus dispatches tasks to its **Feature Builder** agents across the network. Each agent takes a module or feature from the plan and writes the code for it. Highlight that this happens concurrently – multiple pieces of the project are coded in parallel by different agents, which is how Prometheus achieves speed and scale. The user can watch code being added to the GitHub repository live (as commit or pull request activity), providing transparency.
* **4. Automated Testing (Red Team/Bug Finder Agents):** After or during code generation, specialized agents test the output. Explain the **Red Team** step: a set of agents pulls the entire codebase and attempts to run and break it, writing attack scripts or negative tests. Simultaneously, **Bug Finder** agents perform static analysis for bugs or security issues. The system may iterate: if tests fail or bugs are found, builder agents fix the code and new commits are made. This loop continues until the code passes all tests and checks.
* **5. Optimization & Review:** Describe the final refinement. An **Architect/Optimizer agent** reviews the complete codebase to simplify and optimize it (e.g., remove redundancies, improve clarity). At this stage, documentation is also finalized by the Documentation agent (ensuring the code is well-commented and usage guides are prepared). The user might receive a summary of what was built and any important implementation notes.
* **6. Delivery:** Finally, explain how the user receives or accesses the results. Since Prometheus uses Git, the completed project is available in a repository – possibly a fork that the user can merge or download. All code, tests, and documentation are delivered. If there’s a user dashboard, mention that the user would be notified that their project is ready. The user can now run the software or deploy it knowing it has been thoroughly tested.
* **7. Feedback & Iteration:** Encourage users to provide feedback or ask for modifications if the result isn’t exactly what they envisioned. One strength of Prometheus is quick iteration – they can refine the scope or add new features and let the swarm update the project. Point out that this cycle (idea -> code) can repeat for continuous improvement or new ideas.
* **Tips for Best Results:** Alongside the process, offer best practices (especially useful for non-developers). E.g., *“Be as specific as possible when describing your idea, including any requirements or constraints. Break big ideas into smaller features.”* Also reassure that even if the user isn’t sure about technical details, the system will help figure them out through the Q\&A in the scoping stage.
* **Visual Aid:** If possible, include a simple flowchart or numbered infographic of these steps (Idea -> Scope -> Plan -> Code -> Test -> Deliver), to make the process easy to follow at a glance.

## Ensuring Quality: How Prometheus Guarantees Great Results

**Suggested GitBook Path:** `how-it-works/quality-assurance.md`

**Summary:**
Detail the **built-in quality assurance mechanisms** that set Prometheus Swarm apart, to instill confidence in users. This section explains *how* Prometheus consistently delivers high-quality, workable code – addressing common AI concerns like hallucinations, errors, or poor maintainability. By breaking down the safeguards (modular design, tests, multiple agent reviews, etc.), this page reinforces that Prometheus outputs can be trusted in production. It’s essentially the “why you can rely on it” argument, which is crucial for all personas (creators, devs, enterprises) to take action and use the platform.

* **Industrial-Grade Process:** Reiterate that Prometheus applies **industrial process design** principles to AI coding. Every project is broken into small, manageable pieces with clear goals (avoiding ambiguity). Each piece is built and tested independently (like an assembly line for software), ensuring that issues are caught at the component level before integration. This modular approach means the final assembly is smooth and reliable, much like well-manufactured parts fitting together.
* **No Hallucination Guarantee:** Explain how the system minimizes AI “hallucinations” (nonsensical or incorrect outputs). Because agents are given precise sub-tasks and have access to relevant context (including project docs via embeddings), they are less likely to go off-track. Plus, any illogical code is caught during testing phases. If an agent produces code that doesn’t make sense, the testing agents will flag failures, forcing a correction long before the user sees it.
* **Multi-Agent Cross-Verification:** Highlight that different agent roles act as checks and balances on each other. For instance, after a builder agent writes code, a tester agent validates it; if the tester finds a flaw, a fixer agent (or the builder) addresses it. Security or quality issues are further reviewed by the Bug Finder agent. This **swarm collaboration** means the final output has effectively been code-reviewed and vetted by multiple AI “eyes,” reducing the chance of errors slipping through.
* **Consistency and Maintainability:** Note that Prometheus enforces type-safe and consistent coding practices (as mentioned in core features). The generated code isn’t just correct – it’s also cleanly structured and documented, which guarantees that it can be maintained by humans afterwards. This is a key difference from naive AI-generated scripts that might be tangled or cryptic. By delivering human-readable code, Prometheus ensures long-term quality, not just short-term functionality.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Describe how the feedback loops work. Prometheus learns from each task – successful patterns are reused, and any failures teach the system to improve processes. If the platform is updated regularly (mention if there are weekly updates or community contributions), it means the quality will only get better over time. For enterprises, this implies that investing in Prometheus yields compounding returns in reliability.
* **Proven Results:** If available, mention any metrics or success rates (e.g., “X% of Prometheus-generated projects run on first try” or “50+ partners adopted Prometheus within weeks”). Even anecdotal evidence like user testimonials can be cited. For example, highlight the AWS cost reduction story: a developer (Yeet from Koii) used Prometheus techniques to optimize infrastructure, cutting \$80k/month in costs with zero downtime – showcasing the real-world effectiveness of the approach.
* **Assurance for the User:** End by directly reassuring readers: *“With Prometheus Swarm, you don’t just get code quickly – you get code you can **count on**.”* Summarize that the combination of structured planning, rigorous testing, and expert agent collaboration **guarantees a great result** for their project. Encourage them once more to take the leap and use Prometheus for their next development endeavor, knowing quality is a top priority.
